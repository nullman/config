Make SSL Certificates

Make sure the following setup has already taken place...

openssl must be installed:
  apt-get -i openssl

sign.sh must be installed:
  cd /usr/local/bin
  wget http://willert.dk/geek/files/sign.sh
  chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/sign.sh

the /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf file must be setup:
  in the [ CA_default ] section change:
    dir             = /etc/ssl
  in the [ req_distinguished_name ] section put in your specifications:
    countryName_default         = US
    stateOrProvinceName_default = Minnesota
    localityName_default        = Minneapolis
    0.organizationName_default  = My Company
    commonName_default          = mycompany.com
    emailAddress_default        = postmaster@mycompany.com
