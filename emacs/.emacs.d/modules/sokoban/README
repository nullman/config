Staring the Game
================

After installing Emacs Sokoban (see INSTALL) you can start a game of
sokoban with 

  M-x sokoban <RET>


The Goal of the Game
====================

The goal of the game is to place all boulders (or treasures if you
like better) represented by "o"s in the buffer in the pits,
represented by "."s.  The "#"s represent walls.

This has to be done be the player character (the "@") by pushing the
boulders.  You can only push one boulder at a time (you are not strong
enough to push a row of two) and you can't pull them, so be careful
not to put them in a place where they can't be moved anymore.

That's all, easy isn't it?


Playing the Game
================

- Move the player-character using the arrow-keys of your keyboard.
  After finishing a level you will automatically get to the next.
- If you mess up things undo moves by pressing `u' but be aware that
  will be counted as 10 moves (this penalty is customizeable).
- Press `b' to view best players list (the "highscoe" which is a
  low-score in fact).
- Press `<' or`>' to jump back/forth one level.
